Not bad but not great either. I work close by so I end up there for lunch quite a bit. It's definitely worth checking out for lunch as their specials change every day and prepared freshly.

The only reason im giving 4 stars is because the food is great, but the woman that works the counter, is the most rudest woman in the service industry. I brought my own lunch but saw utensils on the outside counter for everyone, however there were only knives, so I nicely asked the woman if I could please have a fork, she responded, we ain't got none, so then I ordered some green beans, I then again asked her for her fork, she looked at me with the rudest face and said, I only got spoons, I said okay that's fine. I sat down to eat my food, next thing you know, there's a ton of people in line, and what's she giving out, forks to people. I can't even.

I'm a pretty big eater, but I could only do lunch here if I took a co-worker and we split one meal between the two of us. I'm a fan of large portions but at almost $12.00 for lunch with a drink, where you either throw 75% of the meal away or you need a person to share it with...no thanks.  I suggested a lunch sized (and priced) option on a couple of occasions when I was there, but it seems to have fallen upon deaf ears. I bet a lunch menu would pick up their lunch time business dramatically. I know I wanted to go several times at lunch but without anyone else to split the meal I was stuck going somewhere else."

After a hard day of yard work with a 104-degree heat index, the last thing I felt like doing was cooking.

So I popped into Pepo's for my usual:  a hot pressed Cuban sandwich and their 3 veggies/sides combo.  I got yellow rice, red beans, and maduros.

The sides were excellent, as always!  But as for this particular Cuban sandwich?

It was not pressed long enough.  No biggie, as I just did a quick fix at home in my oven.

The problem was the ham was really, really fatty.  I ate the first half, but could not endure the second half.  By fatty ham, I mean gristle, and it was almost like having to chew rubber bands.  Call me weak, but I actually gagged!

I had to spit it out, gagged some more, and quickly threw away the second half of my Cuban.

So while I do wish Pepo's the best, it will be a very long time if I ever visit again and try my luck with their Cuban sandwich..."

Ordered two roasted pork. Instead of pulling out fresh pork she used a slotted spoon and spooned out what was left sitting in the liquid, water logged pork with no flavor. I as well ordered two orders plantains, I looked at what was sitting in the tray and it looked real old. I asked if that was all they had, she said no that there was others in the back. What was put in the containers was old dried out plantains and she put in pieces from the tray. A total waste of $20.00. 
It will be a long time before we go back.  Quite a shame too."

My son and I should have shared his beef enchilada because he couldn't finish his meal. I couldn't finish my meal even though I really tried. We will eat smarter next time. The meal I had was a ground beef with rice and beans. It was two plates of delicious food. 

The meal was so tasty. The sides were rice and beans, plus I got a side of plantains. Everything was delicious! The people serving the food were wonderful and helpful and friendly. All in all this was a wonderful experience. When we go back to St. Pete's we will be going here again."

I was visiting the Tampa/St. Pete area for the first time and at lunch, someone suggested this place.  

My initial impression is this place is a small death trap of a location.  There aren't many places to sit so I suggest your take your food to go.  They had lots of already-made food if that's what you're looking for.  I, on the other hand, ordered the ""famous pork wrap"" with everything (including lettuce and tomato).  My experience and seeing the experience of others is if you order the already prepared food, you eat sooner than later.  If you order something they need to prepare (like the famous pork wrap), be ready to wait.....and wait....and wait.

The wrap came out similar to a burrito.  I think the only thing separating this wrap from a burrito is the official label of ""wrap"" and not ""burrito.""

Like a Yelp 3-star review says, my wrap was ""A-OK.""  It wasn't memorable but it wasn't awful.  It came with some sort of cilantro-garlic butter concoction which sketched me out.  My little cup was all separated with the oil on top and I just couldn't being myself to use it.  There wasn't much meat in my wrap but there was plenty of rice.

Um....Not sure I'll be back soon.  There are plenty of other food options in the area to choose from and I'm more likely to try new options than a repeat option.  However, if the group wants Pepo again, I won't put up a fight and try something else beside the wrap."

And im going to be honest Pipo's ain't bad, its actually pretty decent. My beef with the place is the price for a cafeteria style restaurant. I paid 10 bucks for pork, black beans and rice. Now black beans and rice go together as 1. If your cuban you cant have one without the other. That's not 2 sides, that's 1 side, what you trying pull Pipo? When you get off the boat? Now if you threw some platanitos on there maybe id give you guys a pass, And even then 10 bucks man, its just kinda steep. My old lady can whip that up for a kiss on the cheek.

I noticed the empanadas looked big, but in reality, they're bite size if you remove the excess fried dough. I also thought $11 for 75% rice was excessive. Other than that, the food is decent.

I've been avoiding red pork so I cant speak for the pork dishes, but the chicken dishes I've had have all been extremely tender. 
They have fresh tamales and fried plantains that are wonderful as well. I really dig the large quantity of drink options, guava nectar goes perfectly with practically any dish served. They also have cuban coffees, desserts and pastries.

It's not quite like how my abuela makes it, nor any of the other Cuban places I've eaten at. It was definitely lacking that Cuban charm. The Cuban sandwich was pretty good, but the rice, plantains, and chicken, ugh. Plus, they won't be winning any customer service awards any time soon.

Parking is limited, so I was glad to get there early to meet my coworker for lunch last week.

The restaurant is very small, clean and fills up quickly. The staff was very friendly and the service was very good. The portions of food are enormous. Great value for the price. 

With that said, I found the food to be bland. I am a salt-aholic anyways, but even after adding both salt and pepper, there was a still a lack in flavor. The chicken was very dry. The Garbanzo bean soup was lacking in taste, too. My coworker said the chicken was dry that was served on his enchiladas, as well.

This restaurant was unbelievably busy at lunch time, so they must be doing something right. Maybe I just ordered the wrong entree. 

Would I go back? Probably not, the place was hard to find and I am blessed to live close to Columbus Avenue, which is home to many delicious Cuban restaurants. I have been spoiled."

The Cuban sandwich is Roasted Pork, Ham, Swiss, Mustard and a Pickle on a Hot pressed. Done!  Since I have moved to Tampa the variation is to add Salami and Lettuce and Tomato. I dont mind the extra meat. But to add Lettuce and Tomato is to make my Cuban a Slop Sandwidch. Not good. 

The Sandwich my wife ordered was very lackluster It tasted like a hot pressed ham and chesse sandwich .The Resutrant does give nice sized rice and beans portions which is cool. But I can make that at home. 

I gave Pipos one more chance but again failed to deliver. I went one morning craving an empanda at 8:45am. Pipos is open at 8:00am well when I got there the girl told me they havent made any yet !!!!

The tamale was very good, especially with the added roast pork on top with a lil broth. My best tamale every (disclaimer: I don't eat them often)
My Cuban was good; the bread was crisp outside and moist and soft inside, There was a good balance of ham and roast pork, a few more pickles would have been nice with a little less mustardaise.
The roast chicken was flavorful and moist but I would have liked a crisper skin. The plantains were perfect!

The coffee was bold, strong and creamy and the bread slices were flaky and moist, no complaints.

I know where to stop on my next visit to St. Pete!"

The food has always been the one thing I miss from there. Heading in for breakfast this morning and dunking my toast into my cafe con leche....NOSTALGIA galore! The food was not only yummy but it took me back to when I was the youngest  in the family drinking coffee. The empanadas are so delicious! The employees are very kind and welcoming.

I'm not Cuban by any means but this was definitely the best mojo I have had in the 15 years since I started eating chicken not seasoned with Ms. Dash. The sandwiches are easily a 12"" sub size and there was definitely a full chicken breast on mine. Sizeable chunks of onion and green pepper deliver a wonderful crunch. Boyfriend loved his Cuban too, but didn't have too many comments because his mouth was too full. Not to mention the great prices!"

They have several hot main options available with which you add two sides for typically less than $7-8. In addition, there is a full menu from which you can order as well. 
I really want to give the place 3.5 stars as sometimes the hot options are a little bland. Today I had the chicken enchilada, which was a little too much bread for my taste, and the only flavor was in the sauce they put on it. Inside was only plain testing chicken, albeit a lot of it. 
Fortunately, they have multiple homemade salsa/sauces which you can use to add some flavor.

It is classic Cuban food made by the family who has owned the business since the beginning. I get the bourbon chicken on Thursdays. It is awesome I get it with white rice a double order and their Cuban bread. It comes from a famous bakery in Tampa and is always good. You are not going to get any fancy service they pretty much leave you alone and let you do your thing. Very quaint and nice little place to visit. The food is very good and well-made. We at least go there every other month. It's a great place to take a friend to go talk and relax.

Their food definitely makes up for the minor hassle.  The hot pressed Cuban sandwich here is really excellent.  One of the best in St. Pete!

The small, cafeteria-style selection of Cuban entrees and sides are also really great.

Often with my Cuban, I'll also bring home a side of rice/beans/maduros (ripe plantains), and am able to get 2 or 3 meals out of my order for a very affordable price here.

The chicken and pork were super tender and flavorful. I love the plantains were my favorite sweet and carmalized to perfection.

Both dishes were good but what makes them Cuban and unique is not easily discerned. The pork could have been on either Hawaiian luau or North  Carolina barbecue plates. The rice was well prepared and the black beans had a pronounced olive oil flavor. 

Near me sat three very large young Cuban men who had to take food home as did I. The help is very friendly and try to find ways to make your time spent as pleasant as possible. I would hope I will find other restaurants in this area where I will say ""Ah, so this is Cuban."""

They always have main hot entrees you can order right then or you can order off of the menu and have the food brought out to your table. I generally order the Mojo Chicken plate with rice and beans...and let me tell you, they give you plenty of food! I always have to get a to-go box.

It's a small place so I wasn't sure. I placed a to-go order for their mojo chicken breast with rice and she had a salad (made to order.) When I picked up the order I noticed that there was heating lamps keeping large amounts of food warm (several pans of pre-cooked chicken breasts.) The chicken was dry and looked as if it was under a lamp--buffet style--which was consistent with my observations.  The yellow rice was decent but I've had better. It needed some black beans mixed in. The salad was a salad but they forgot the dressing and olives on it. I'd be willing to try their sandwiches but not their dinner again.

I will give them another try, not on a weekend, maybe it will be better? Cafe con leche didnt have sugar in it, I guess I'm used to in being already in. The ""ropa vieja"" was dry and flavorless. No onions or peppers IN it, there were a few chopped raw onions on top. Not even sure they gave me the right thing? Maybe they were out, gave me the mojo pork and threw some chopped onions on top thinking this gringa wont know the difference. And that Cuban bread... What. The. Fudge. What Cuban cuts their bread like that? Pretty sure it was just French bread too, it didnt have the right crisp texture on the outside. But maybe that's because it was sliced and toasted the way I'm used to. 

Also, the meal was to be ordered with two sides. I ordered rice and Cuban bread. It already came with rice and bread so I got doubles of each? You should have on your menu what meals are served with. I would have ordered double veggies had I known it came with plain rice and French bread.

I ended up with a beef empanada and a Cuban sandwich.

The Mrs and I went a few days ago and let me tell you that I was sad. Sad because I drive by here almost every single day and not once stoped by. That changes today. I had the shredded pork with black beans and white rice. Maduro (plaintains) and an empanada. Mrs. had the beef monfongo. We loved our meal. The pork was moist. I asked for extra sauce drizzled on my rice and really glad I did. The beans were good, could use a extra salt but that might just be me. They do offer some condiments, onions, salt pepper. The empanada was good but not my favorite. I'll have to try the chicken next time. But I'm not saying they were terrible! They were good! 
We walked in and the place was clean, welcomed with smiles and the first thing you see is dessert! Had the flan which I didn't try because Mrs. destroyed it before I could ask. So it's fantastic (so I'm told lol). We will 100% be back to try some more items. But be warned, bring your appetite!"

The food was excellent, the service fast and friendly and the prices were reasonable. How this place doesn't have four or more stars, I do not understand. 

My husband and I have not moved to St Petersburg yet but we plan to.  We found this restaurant to be conveniently located on the way to Gandy Bridge and 275.  Luckily, my husband insisted on stopping even though I was a bit more cautious because of the reviews. I AM SO GLAD WE DID. 

The portions were well beyond generous and the hostess even allowed us to taste some of the food to assist us in selecting our meal. She was absolutely wonderful, friendly and sweet. 

They had chimichurri sauce and a red tomato sauce that you could freely refill.  We had food there and bought some empanadas for our very long drive back to DC.  

Although, I can understand that there is limited paved parking, there is quite a bit of extra space in the grass area.  Also, instead of making so many u-turns when driving South on 4th you can take the back dirt road that easily let's you get to the location. 

SO, DONT LET THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS STOP YOU.  THIS HAS TO BE SOME OF THE BEST CUBAN FOOD IN THE AREA."

The couple who owned it for as long as I can remember passed away a couple years ago. The current owners have tried to keep the deli the same with the same potato salad recipe, potato knish, potato pancakes and homemade breads. 
I stopped in last week and while it wasn't as busy as it used to be, I enjoyed a stacked hot corned beef sandwich on thick homemade rye bread. Delicious. 
Tried a potato pancake to see if they were the same while a friend ordered the potato salad. They gave me sour cream out of a condiment package (which is fine, I guess. Just felt less like the home-like place it used to be). 
If you like NY style delis, boars head and homemade bread- it's worth a stop. But don't expect a fine dining experience or for warmth beyond your hot pastrami or corned beef."

Absolutely delicious. The only reason that I cannot give more stars is the fact that two out of the three times I've been there, and despite the fact that we've had reservations, we've had to wait for over an hour for our table. That is a long time to stand as there is no waiting area inside (we literally had to hover in the center of tables with people eating around us) and it was too cold outside to wait there. If you don't mind the wait, this is an awesome BYOB, definitely a hidden gem."

I'm an admitted italian snob. I grew up with a grandmother who can make the meanest, meltiest veal parmesan you've ever had. So, no surprise, most restaurants at their best are ""pretty okay"" to the worst being ""wtf did I just eat"".

Bona Cucina is an absolute gem for pasta dishes. I've never ordered a meat/fish entree, save a side of meatballs that were hearty and full of flavor. The pasta tastes fresh, is cooked properly... and I swear, the cannolis are the best I've ever had in my entire life (please don't tell my family). The servers there are very nice, and the pace of the meal reminds me more of eating at the family dinner table. Also, BYO, like most places in the area. I consider it a plus to be able to bring my favorite bottle of wine.

Service can be a little ""slow"" compared to most restaurants (especially chains), but if you are expecting fast italian then you basically don't want fresh italian. The wait and dinner conversation is worth every bite. 

Also, the restaurant is cozy - if you're bringing a big group, make sure to call ahead."

The waitress was very friendly, and funny.  I had the special appetizer...stuffed portobella mushroom with spinach and cheese, and I believe sausage.  It was delicious, and I could have stopped there because I was so full after.  I had the orange roughy covered in lump crabmeat and my husband had the flounder.  His meal looked average, but it was a very plain dish.  He liked it though.  My meal was the best I have had in a long time.  The piece of fish I had was moist and huge.  The crabmeat was too much for me to finish, and it was sweet and juicy.  I loved it!  We ordered tiramisu and cheesecake for dessert.  The tiramisu was amazing, but the cheesecake tasted gross.

The waitress is extremely nice and explains everything on the menu. She is certain to explain that there is ONE CHEF, he makes everything himself and things take time. I'm glad she was honest and we knew what to expect. 

Garlic bread is delicious. Eggplant app really good too. We had he stuffed mushroom app, it was okay. 

For entrees: she was certain to note that the chicken parm is not breaded. I ordered anyway but it wasn't that good. Plain chicken breast with mozzarella and sauce is kind of odd when not fried.

Veal scallopini, also odd, they could have seared the veal a little to add some color. 

The tortellini was good!

I tried this restaurant last week and found it to be okay.  Not great, just okay.  If you like your portions large and your entrees extremely saucy, then this place is for you.  

There is authentic Italian food and then there is Americanized Italian food.  This is more of the latter.  Portions were very large.  Both chicken dishes that were ordered were covered in large amounts of cheese and smothered in sauce.  They were tasty, but in moderation.  After a few bites, I felt like I needed a nap.  

The cannolis for dessert were delicious.  

Prices were moderate for the amount of food you are served.  

The restaurant is small, romantically lit and cozy with an old school Italian restaurant vibe.

Definitely nothing fancy but you feel like you are having dinner in someone's home. The food is delicious, atmosphere is warm and cozy. Did I mention that the food is unbelievable? It can take quite some time to get your entree, so make sure to eat the delicious bread and order appetizers. 

The service is one of a kind.  The only downfall is that parking is at a minimum with a small lot in back and some spaces on the street in front.

I like my Italian AUTHENTIC, OLD SCHOOL, FAMILY OWNED & MAFIA-TIZED! 

This little Italian restaurant in the middle of Lansdowne/Upper Darby PA really brought the heat when it comes to Classic & Authentic Italian Food!

Who would have thought? This is for sure one of those places that a friend must tell you about to really even come across or consider. Not exactly a ""charming"" neighborhood or a place anyone would casually drive by. From the outside, this place is no looker...but as you step inside you know you've found a hidden gem!

- Family Owned and run Restaurant (Mother/Daughter were working the tables Friday night). The mother made me feel like she was my sweet Italian mother in law from Long Island (Yet born and raised in Italy). 

- They are very loyal to their regulars... and Friday night that regular happened to be a ""Bobby 'Bacala' Baccalieri"" look-a-like in full on velour jogging suit with his freshly french tipped wife.

- The restaurant is small and has a very cozy and rustic feel to it. Very ""Old School"" decor with a bit of Nona's living room style thrown into it. 

- BYOB and PERFECT for a laid back DATE NIGHT! I wouldn't suggest this as a great place to bring kids... they would kinda kill the mood in this joint. Great spot to bring your Parents to dinner when they are in town though!

- The food here is simply DELIZIOSO! Perfected Italian Entrees! I would highly suggest you stick with the Chicken & Veal dishes.. but by all means try it all, including their specials! They have an addictive Cream of Asparagus Soup and I'm sure all of their creamy soups are out of this world. After reading Kaitlin L. and another food bloggers review of Boca Cucina I decided to order the CHICKEN CELESTE (breast of chicken topped with imported proscuitto, roasted red peppers, smoked provolone cheese and white wine sauce). My dish was amazing and I look forward to trying many many more here!

My husband and I want to be apart of this Bona Cucina Family and aim to be treated like a regular Soprano. Next time we return it's matching volour joggin suits and a big bottle of Pino!

Ciao Baby!"

Mussels in white wine, garlic bread the way no one makes it any more, a giant Caprese  with perfect tomatoes, big enough to share, linguini with shrimp and crabmeat (yum!), spinach ravioli in blush red sauce, four of us shared and had lots of leftovers.

I must have driven past it hundreds of times without realizing that it was there, thankfully that has all changed. Bona Cucina is a hidden gem that serves some of the area's best food. Its intimate setting makes you feel like you are having a meal at your grandmother's house surrounded by your family. I cannot say it enough, but the food is excellent, I wish that I could try everything on the menu multiple times. Aside from the delicacies coming out of the kitchen, the atmosphere at Bona Cucina is phenomenal, unassuming and anti-elitist.  The only drawback is the parking, but that is only a minor afterthought that should not prohibit you from getting there."

Our opinion about the food:  there were some very good items (loved the sauteed chicken parmigiana, broiled crab cakes, and a portobello mushroom/sausage/spinach appetizer).  But a number of items were just average or worse (eg: caprese salad without basil and drenched in what seemed like bottled salad dressing, chewy smallish meatballs that tasted like they were from a freezer bag, over-cooked pasta, heavy gnocchi, bread that I'm sure was just steak sandwich rolls...and the greatest disappointment -- cannoli with wonderfully rich filling, but damp shells from being filled too far in advance).  The prices were reasonable (our bill was $160), but entrees are all a la carte.  A basic iceberg lettuce salad is  +$3, soup is +$3/$5.  Service was slow, despite how early we arrived.  One water glass on our table had red lipstick marks on the rim -- pretty awful!  Would we visit again?  I'm not sure we would... driving home, we talked the experience over, and -- I'm sad that we concluded this -- the Olive Garden would have been equally as satisfying as Bona Cucina.   Two last details -- if you do go, it's a BYOB and cash only."

Took my wife for her Bday. Was very disappointed when I ordered the veal parm and didn't like how thin cut the veal was or the marinara sauce. When I told the waitress, and she looked at me like I was crazy, then offered if I wanted something else. Finally got the other meal and bill and she didn't take the other dish off my bill. I was completely offended by her attitude, as if I don't know what good food taste like. I didnt want to argue so I just paid the whole thing. I won't be back I tell you that!

Stuffed mushrooms, crab imperial and the grilled zucchini is DELICIOUS. My first visit there I had the seafood portifino and it was enough to feed 3 of us. I had it for lunch and dinner the next day. I had always driven past this place and never paid any attention to it and I am glad that I did. The atmosphere is very quiet with dim lighting. The only thing that I would suggest, is that they start accepting credit cards. Alot of people such as myself almost never carry cash and accepting credit cards would be very convenient.

I took my Fiancee to the unassuming, charming little restaurant for our 1 year engagement anniversary.  I always forget this place is there.  If you look at the front of it, you'd never know it was even open.  Going in, I was absolutely amazed at how busy it was.  The food is old fashioned, like Nonna made it, and took me back to when I was a kid, sitting in her kitchen.  The  Veal San Remo was fantastic, and white (not grey or red).  You can tell that every dish is made with care and the chef is on the mark with everything.

As an added bonus, Bona Cucina is a BYOB, and I highly recommend that you do.  It's well established that service is a little on the slow side, but everything is absolutely worth the wait, and since you brought a bottle, you have time to uncork it and socialize.  For myself, uncorking a bottle and socializing is absolutely an integral portion of the experience.

Don't go if you're in a rush, but to take the time for a romantic dinner with your better half, there is nothing better.  Leave the cell phones put away, and enjoy the experience."

I love the place and the people. Every time I've been there, 20 or more times, the food is good and the staff is friendly. The vitello saltimbocca is a favourite of mine and they do it well but everything I've eaten there was quite good.

The only downside to the restaurant would be the building. There are quite a few tables squeezed into the space and they don't seem all that well organised. The food is so good, I can't say that I've ever regretted being in one area or another.

We went on a sunday around 7:30 and it was not busy at all, only 2 other tables. We were greeted by the most friendly waitress ever. She told us the specials and gave us a few moments to decide on what to order. After looking at the menu and trying to make a decision sonce everything looked so good I decided to get a ceasar salad and chicken napalitano. My boyfriend got the mussels in white sauce and veal parm. 

Our appitiZers were out in no time. The aroma fron the mussels was mouthwatering. There must have been more then 3 dozen mussles in the pot and there was enough sauce leftover to dip the crunchy seeded bread in. My ceasar salad was good, usual ceasar salad with crunchy crutons, not to much dressing.  

The chicken napalitano was amazing.  It was the most tender chicken breast with so much flavor. The mozzarella was so creamy and there was a piece of prosciutto between the chicken and cheese which gave the chicken a great flavor. There was this light tomato wine like sauce and the taste was to die for.  There tomatos were so plump and the artichokes were perfect.  The flavors all went so well together. 

I tasted the veal parm and that was also delicious. The red saice was so flavorful, the veal so tender and breaded perfectly.  

Of course I had to get dessert. There is a book to look through with about 10 pictures. I wanted to choose a little piece of everything but I decided to get the chocolate chip cannoli. The waitress said her husband makes the filling and it is not to sweet and the perfect flavor. She was right. The cannoli shell had the perfect crisp and taste. The filling was the best i have had. It came bursting out of the shell and the cannolinis big enough for 2, although i ate all of it lol. After eating all the cannoli i wanted to get another one to bring it home. Perfect cannoli i have to say. 

I highly recommend this little resturant for great italian cuisine.  The staff is friendly, feels like you are eating at a relatives house. One downfall is cash only."

I have been coming here for years upon years and have never had a bad meal (granted, I got veal marsala for about 6 years straight). 
Best appetizers: Stuffed portabella mushroom, steamed mussels in white wine broth, and basically any of the cream soups/bisques. 
Best meals: any meat. It is so tender, you rarely need a knife to cut it! The pasta is ok, but their chicken and veal dishes are what really sing. 
Frankie, the waitress (and wife of the owner/chef Pat) is sassy but a fabulous waitress. The place is small and usually quite loud on weekends, but that is exactly the way a good BYO Italian restaurant should be.

Portabello's
Fellini's
Guiseppes
etc...
The write ups on Bona are very good so we gave it a try. This is a quaint little neighborhood Italian restaurant...which I like. The main room as some ambiance while the upstairs room is just a plain room.
We shared an appetizer special of Portabello mushroom with crab. It was VERY big but the flavor was lacking. No big deal.
My friend had a special called Chicken Genovese which was also bland in flavor. It looked good but taste was mediocre.
I had the Seafood Pasquale which was very good. It had the largest shrimp I had ever seen...and lots of it.

Forget about it ! We were there wihen another table that had 18 people at it came in and there were other scattered tables around  with parties of 2,4 and six people. The entire restaurant was being serviced by a mother, the owner, and her daughter.  It was an hour before we even got bread. 
The service was just terrible. I could never get a refill on my icewater, we couldn't get cracked pepper or cheese for our Caesar salads ... The servers never stopped long enough to ask us if we needed anything or for us to ask them for what we needed. It was a drop and run Situation. They
 threw the salads on the table and left. We couldn't get their attention to get ourselves some pepper or cheese  for at least 10 minutes. The funny thing is, we are an aggressive family. We would get up and look for them and they were nowhere to be found.
We were there 3 hours. Ridiculous... 
The Caesar salads were very vinegary. The bread was not warm. The mussels were so garlicy that we could barely eat them. The pasta was good but the sauce was a little tangy. 
HOWEVER THE ENTRÉES WERE VERY TASTY AND WELL PREPARED. THE PRICES WERE GOOD AND THE FOOD WAS PLENTIFUL...
Unless you see the small print within the menu, you would not know that it is a cash only restaurant until after they give you the bill at the end of the evening. You would think if you are making reservations for a party of 10 that they might mention to you on the phone, "" by the way, this is a cash only restaurant"".We did not have enough cash and we had to leave our license and go to a Mac machine to get money. So there are two servers, who are the owners, and it's cash only.

Last night I ordered the. Veal carcifo which normally is amazing and I must say it was subpar. The white wine sauce was separated and extra oily. I was extremely disappointed especially since this place usually is a treat for me.  The green  beans you can tell are caned and lack any flavor.  My boyfriend got the chicken Parm and the amount of chicken he received was slacking. Sauce was alright but still lacking flavor.  I must say the clams casino were extremely good. The chef may have changed or there is a lack of care with the food but it was very underwhelming.  I don't think I. Will ever be back which is a shame.

EVERYTHING. SO GOOD.

From the soups (crab bisque for the husband, cream of broccoli for me) to the bread to the phenomenal main courses, everything lived up to the hype.

I can see why everyone says the chicken dishes are the stand-outs - my husband's was incredible, and I don't normally like Italian chicken dishes - but I have to give a shout-out to the pasta dishes as well. I had gnocchi and my friend had spinach ravioli and OH. MY GOODNESS. 

My friend said the alfredo sauce on his ravioli was the best he's ever had, and he's had a lot of alfredo sauce.

Cannot believe this unassuming BYO is so good, but it really and truly is. COME HERE. Now."

A fantastic meal. The owner visited our table and took our orders. She was fantastic! Made us feel like we were eating at a relatives house. Had the lobster/ crab bisque for starters. Many restaurants will make this soup much too rich. It was perfectly balanced. My entree was Veal Oscar. The veal was incredibly tender and topped with an abundance of crabmeat. Although this restaurant is a good distance from my home in Delaware...I will be back.

We had a group of 9 plus a baby. We had reservations for 7:30pm. There were some other large parties and it seemed like the small restaurant was packed with nothing but parties. If you don't have a reservation for a Saturday night, you may be out of luck. After driving through not the best of neighborhoods, you stumble on this small byob with a small parking lot. Half of our group had to park down the residential street which was fine (parking was still less of a headache than my neighborhood in Bella Vista. The decor is average. The food is amazing. I live in the Italian Market and have been to almost every restaurant there and Bona Cucina's dished beat most of the dishes I have had in my own neighborhood. 

We did somewhat of a family style and shared different entrees For appetizers, I tried the eggplant rollatini and Caesar salad. Both were very good. To me, Caesar salad is Caesar salad. The eggplant rollatini is very filling.  The seafood pasquale with marinara is so so big and is like 2 meals in itself; the sauce is very good and the shrimp and crab in it were plentiful with an enormous serving of pasta. The chicken napolitano was the best chicken dish I have had in awhile; the chicken was so tender and had the most amazing taste mixed with the cheese. I was full after the appetizers but could not stop myself from eating the entrees. The spinach ravioli with rosa sauce was very good but I think next time I would try it with marinara (but that is just my opinion as I prefer marinara over creamy sauces). Because we had such a big party, they also hooked our table up with extra pasta with marinara sauce and zucchini. The zucchini is awesome and cooked just right. They also brought all of our dishes out at the same time and all were still hot (at many other restaurants they screw this part up with big parties). 

We had some sort of chocolate oreo cake and tiramisu for dessert. The oreo cake was awesome especially if you are a chocolate fan. I am not a big tiramisu fan but I still enjoyed it. 

My only complaint is the service. We sat down at about 7:40pm and they didn't take our orders until about 8:20pm. I understand that the kitchen was busy especially with all the big parties and I could tell by something that the waitress stated that they would cook up one table's orders at a time which I guess does make sense given all the large parties. They also give you complimentary bread and butter. The bread was fine but I prefer olive oil with my bread over butter especially at an Italian restaurant. Also, the bread dishes were very small and we were sharing appetizers so we asked one of the girls who I think was a bus girl for some plates. She looked at us bewildered by the request and asked us what they were for. Then a few minutes after she brought the plates, she came to clear some of our old dishes away and then tried to remove our eggplant rollatini without even asking and we had like half the dish left so I had to quickly tell her not to take it. In the end, I am glad we had a 3 hour dinner because it was nice catching up with old friends. 

Another recommendation for the restaurant-  They never offered to chill our white wine or beer for us so our white wine and beer got kind of room temperate throughout the night; I've never encountered this as most byob will offer to give you an ice bucket for your white wine and refrigerate the beer until you drink it.

But they did take time to take pictures of our party for us at the end of the night and were great at surprising my friend with a cake and candle and singing 'Happy Birthday.' And our waitress did seem like a nice woman.

It is cash only. But prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. If you live in or around Philly and quality of food is most important to you in a restaurant then you must try this place.

As for food- this place is a 5. But I must lower it to a 4 since there are a few service things that could be better."

The waitress was a little handsy which made me uncomfortable, I'm sure it wasnt meant badly but I didnt appreciate it. 

I dont think I'll personally go back because for the price and what I'm getting I could go elsewhere, but this isn't a bad place for food, just a little more than I would have wanted to pay.

The stuffed portabella are worth the price but that might be it.

Because of the holiday, they had a smaller menu to choose from, but it was great. I had the roasted peppers as an appetizer, then had crab stuffed scallops as a main meal. I topped it off with a fresh cannoli for dessert and it was to die for. 

The fact that it's a BYO makes it even better. The atmosphere was great - friendly staff, table cloths, everything was really nice. I am definitely looking forward to the next time I go back. I don't think any Italian food will be able to compare now that I've experienced Bona Cucina!!"

Place has been around 30 years, hasn't changed, and probably won't ever.  If it ain't broke ... 

Service is very good, oozing with Delco charm.  Definitely a neighborhood spot with regulars, the kind of place where the patrons hug the waitress on the way out.  We didn't quite get THAT treatment, but were made to feel like regulars despite it being our first time.

Between the 4 of us, we had the Italian Wedding Soup, a salad, Chicken Napolitano, Crab Cakes, Gnocci and meatballs with marinara, and the Seafood Pasquale with marinara.  All were delicious.  Food snobs will say the dishes were over-sauced, and they're right, but who cares?  That's a red gravy house for you.  Eat it anyway, you'll be glad you did.

The waitress recommended the cannoli for dessert, and thankfully she did.  I loathe cannoli so much I rarely even try a taste of someone else's, but my bite of my wife's was very good.  Can't believe I'm saying this:  I wish I had left some room for one of my own.

Portions are massive -- I had enough leftovers for 3 more meals (at least) -- and reasonably priced even if not battalion-sized.

The negative:  it's kinda inconvenient if you don't live nearby.  It has a very small parking lot, though plenty of street parking.  It's small and tight.  You'll need reservations.  The walls and carpet look like Civil War remnants -- I don't want this place to modernize and lose its charm, but it is looking worn and could use a touch-up.

Also note:  CASH ONLY.  Also BYOB.

We liked it a lot and would return if in the area."

The spinach and cheese ravioli were pillowy heaven and the alfredo I chose to go on top was out of this world.  A little sharper than other alfredos which was superb.  My husband had the tortellini, which were so tender and served super hot, as was all of our food.

We brought two bottles of wine, which the server opened for us right away (my lone real complaint was that they didn' t bring an ice bucket for the white wine, and I forgot to ask).  Unfortunately, they also didn't turn on the air conditioner until we got there, which was INCREDIBLY LOUD.  Once the temperature got down to normal, it was mostly like eating at home with our own moderately loud air conditioner, but for those ten minutes, we were practically yelling across the table.

Appetizers were tasty, especially the specials - cream of asparagus soup and portabella mushroom stuffed with sausage, spinach and feta.  Main courses were also delicious, but reeeeaaallly slow. Don't come to this restaurant if you don't have a lot to talk about and definitely get an appetizer, because it's going to be a while before you see the main course.  The meat dishes were delicious and tender.  If you want leftovers, get the tortellini - my cousin's entree could have fed a family of four. Also get the rosa sauce, it's fantastic.

We didn't order dessert because we brought along our own ice cream cake, but they also served that beautifully.  Overall, it's a good experience, but I definitely prefer it in the non-A/C season."

Waited for our anniversary to give them a shot. I should of read my yelp reviews more carefully, as on the bottom of the menu, it reads Cash Only! Had to walk across the street to hit up an ATM.  

They were very busy when we arrived on a Saturday Night, had a reservation for 2.  Were seated very promptly but then the wait began, They did have 2 large parties of at least 12 going on the same time.  We waited at least 15 minutes for wine glasses, only one was clean.  I do not know about you but a good restaurant should have at least double the supplies as the number of seats.

Order was taken, we ordered Clams Casino which was very good, I ordered Veal Parmesan and the wife Linguine Alfredo w/ Shrimp. The portions were ginormous. The veal no lie was at least 15 inches long and 6 inches in diameter. It came with a side of rigatoni. I only was able to eat half.  It was okay just had no wow factor.  The sauce was a little bland for me, but the cheese was exceptional.   The Linguine was a huge bowl that you could feed a family of 4 with, again the Alfredo sauce was bland. 

The bill was a little more pricier then expected and the food not up to par.  The servers hardly checked in on you and took forever to pick up the check. I do not know if it was a bad night but i do not think we will be returning.  But hey at least we can say we tried someplace new."

The first time the food was phenomenal but the service was a bit slow...the server is also the owner/wife of the chef.  She is extremely friendly and makes you feel like you are in her home.  The problem the first time is that we went around Christmas and the restaurant was full.  

This time we came on a Tuesday night...there was only four or five other tables and once again our server made us feel very welcome.  We ordered the pepper and spinach stuffed portabello...loaded with toppings and only $8.95 to boot.  Our three entrees consisted of veal saltimbocca (mine and I ate every bite!), chicken parmesan and chicken nepolitana.  The meals were something you would expect to find in your Italian grandmothers kitchen.  Perfect sauce, huge portions and great flavor.  

If you're in the area of Upper Darby you need to stop in and experience the great service and great food.  Entrees average around $15 each, being a BYO you can enjoy any wine you choose to bring and without a corkage fee.  

There are some mixed reviews on this location...my reccomendation is give them a chance, it's affordable and worth it."

The owner of the restaurant served us and she was wonderful. Gave us a hug on the way out. I have a feeling she has never met a stranger.

Really good bread to start. We got the arancini appetizer to start. It was really good. I got the crab and lobster bisque as well. Rich and creamy. Delicious! 

I got the mussels with white sauce as my main dish. You can also get a small dish of pasta to go with it. The mussels came in their own pot. The sauce could have been a little more flavorful. Next time, I will get the red sauce. 

My daughter and my pop had the seafood ravioli. They loved it and ate every bite. My SIL had the chicken parmesan. He really liked his too. 

For dessert, we had to try the house made cannoli. My Italian father declared it the best he ever had! 

I will happily return again!"

Italian is a whole different animal there--adventurous, charismatic, but still very palatable. Bona Cucina? Plays it safe, does it pretty well, at a good price. If you are in Lansdown, this place passes--but not worth travelling to.

I love the family feel of the joint, but the food just isn't dynamite. My crab and lobster bisque was good, my veal was oddly breaded and a bit too lemony (lump crabmeat on top was good). Long wait for food is OK because we are forewarned about it in the menu.

This classic establishment has room for improvement, but doesn't need to do it. Regulars love it and it has a reputation that precedes it; just not the spot for me."

The area isn't the greatest and it looks like a hole in the wall. This is an old school italian restaurant and the interior could also use some updating. We were seated at nice large table.

For starters, we had the garlic bread and the mussels in white wine sauce. They were both great. I highly recommend the mussels, they were probably the best I have had. I really could not stop eating them! For dinner, I had the chicken parm and my husband had the gnocchis. He loved the gnocchis, I tried them too and they were delicious. My chicken parm was good, but I would have liked it better if the chicken was breaded. It also came with a side of pasta. Overall, everyone in our group seemed satisfied with their meals. The portions are huge, we went home with a ton of leftovers. Service was good, no complaints. I had heard this place was expensive, but I found the prices to be extremely reasonable.

I stopped by before a show. They have a small parking lot, which is nice. I was sitting upstairs overlooking the downstairs dining room. It's a small restaurant with decor that seems a bit outdated.

The meal starts off with regular cold tasteless white bread and butter. For an appetizer I had the mussels. The mussels themselves were large and tasty. The broth didn't add much flavor to it. My entree was veal parm with some pasta. It was a large thin succulent slice of veal. At first I thought I wasn't going to be able to eat it all, but once I got started eating it I couldn't stop. I was certainly happy with my entree choice.

The waitress was very pleasant and I did enjoy my entree. It probably is the best place to eat in Upper Darby, but that isn't saying much. They would need to step it up to compete in Philly."

The appetizers and bread are delicious. I recommend the mussels with white sauce or tomato Bruciette. 

The entrees are all home made and whether you go with pasta, steak or seafood you ill not be disappointed. 

I recommend the Spinach Ravioli with Rosa sauce and a side of meatballs. every time I eat the meatballs I get a tear in my eye thinking about my old Italian grandmother and I am Irish so you figure it out.

We love the food. Starters: fabulous lobster/crab bisque, stuffed mushrooms, eggplant rollatini, huge pot of muscles. Great crusty bread.

We stopped by here a few months ago and found out we needed reservations so we made some for this weekend.  

So many positive reviews and I'm sad I'm the negative one.  

Luckily we arrived at 5pm (opening) since there are only a few parking spaces 

Appetizers-
Salad- my friend had the salad and wasn't impressed as it was iceberg lettuce (didn't realize restaurants still serve iceberg)

Mozzarella and tomatoes - this was very tasty and we all enjoyed it 

Lobster and crab bisque-  hated it.  All cream and not one single bit of lobster or crab.  Seriously- not one single chunk of crab or lobster.  I had less then half of the cup 

Dinner
Gnocchi and meatball (added charge for meatball).  My friend was not impressed with the sauce.   She took most of it home but tossed it 

Lasagna and meatball (added charge for meatball).  Friend was not crazy about her meal and ate less then half 

Stuffed Scallops.  For $24 I was hoping it would be amazing but it was horrible.   The scallops were chewy with no taste or seasoning.  I had two scallops and stopped.   Took the rest home and tossed it 

Dessert.  After our appetizer and dinner we decided not to chance it 

Waitress was nice but you would think with so much food we did NOT eat she would ask if it was ok.  Nope!  

$95 and exactly 1 hour later we were out the door and disappointed. 

They only accept cash!

Definitely will not be back."

I am not typically a huge fan of red sauce, but this was delicious.  My boyfriend ordered the Strip Steak which I had a few bites of (of course) and that too was excellent.

If you like a lack of attention,  slow service by low class servers, this place may be for you. They were not very welcoming to me or my guests. Instead they were very curious about how we found them and where we were from. 
I believe in being honest. As far as the food is concerned, I found it was decent at best. Not impressed at all.  The menu was typical of any Italian restaurant. They had decent specials as well. 
Pricing was very fair considering the ambiance and cleanliness was subpar. I would not recommend this restaurant,  but it would not take much for the owners to clean it up a little and provide the servers with additional training in customer service,  hospitality and efficency.
Save your time and money. There are too many other nicer Italian restaurants that are willing to give better service in a cleaner environment."

They also serve coffee and sandwiches as well.

I called before we came and sadly they didn't have the ingredients to make a whole cake but the very friendly man on the phone sold me on all the other vegan options like cannolis, donuts, cookies, lemon bars and more. When ordering we spoke to the friendly man on the phone and the pastry chef, aka one of the owners as well. He said they are constantly working on new vegan options which is so cool. We tried the cannoli while we were there which wasn't overly sweet and was very good. We also got a lemon bar and cronut (as I call it - a vegan glazed donut but it's like a croissant!) to go. We almost got some vegan soft serve as well but the machine wasn't turned on so we will have to come back. He said the soft serve is almond based and could be served as a custard now but no worries, we will have another opportunity to come back and try even more goodies. If you haven't stopped in, what are you waiting for?!

By no means does it taste like the chemical brownie you get at Publix or the illegal brownie made by my friend and her boxed brownie mix. Its heavenly and worth every penny paid for it.

I know that this one in particular is filled with high-school aged kids who normally have no manners toward their server, especially at this time of night. It was roughly 10 pm when my party of three was sat last night. The server, Donnie, was very friendly at first. But I don't think he was having a good night. 

My friends and I had just finished a Painting With a Twist activity where we worked up a big appetite. But since the apps at Applebees are half price after 9, why not save us all some money and just order a couple appetizer's to share between us all? Anyway, as we were ordering the apps, the server had to verify that we wanted the ""half-price ones."" My guess is that for half the price, you also get half the portion, whatever. Our app's took about 15 minutes (not bad!) only to be ran by the table by someone other than our server. As we were all very hungry, we dug right in! 

About 5 minutes into chatting and picking at our food, the server just dropped our check, while walking by, and said ""let me know if you's need anything. He didn't even ask if everything was okay, and it wasnt. The one order of BBQ must of came with 5 small pieces of boneless wings, and they were hardly tosed in sauce, one piece - was totally and completely dry. We also had to flag a manager down to ask for some sour cream with our nachos. So, figuring out that we were recieving no service whatsoever, we decided to finish up and get out of there. 

Our check was $23.00. Since two of us at our table are servers and understand there are bad nights, we still left Donnie about $9.00. I really hope this guy understands that even though one or two tables may be totally rude toward you, you should still work as hard as you can to please the next. Clearly, we were not high school kids who wanted all seperate checks and the remote to a TV. We just wanted a pleseant bite to eat after a fun night of Painting. Thanks, Donnie."

The person who took the cards for payment was to split it between two, and ran it twice on the same card, so had to go back and redo.  My son-in-law is an activer serviceman and there was to be a 10% discount.  We mentioned three times about the discount and when she ran the cards, she never put it on.  I guess math is not her strong point.  Then the worst is we get home and we are missing items, some meals were not as full as they should have been and I think grilled veggies should be cut and not put in as chunks.

We started with the Ultimate Trio combo of Steak Quesadilla Towers, Brew Pub Pretzels and Spinach Artichoke dip. All were very good but the dip could have used more tortilla chips. I had the Bourbon Black & Blue burger and my wife had the Cowboy burger - both were good and we would both order them again. Service was quick and efficient. We did order the appetizer with our drinks so we received it first and were not even done with it by the time our burgers arrived. We were done and out the door by 6:30. We have had significant waits when going here later but that has been our experience at almost every restaurant in the area. I hate waiting so we eat early and avoid the hassle. My only complaint would be price - $15 for the appetizer and $10.40 for each burger but I guess that's par for the course with restaurants like this. At least the burgers come with fries. The above mentioned items and a large Miller Lite draft came to $39.60 after a 10% discount we had and before tip."

Caesar salad was ok. A bit overdressed. 

The feature menu item- sundried tomato chicken pasta... Is no longer offered. (Please take it off the menu!!)

So I had fajitas... The chicken is ok. Sauce is horribly salty. Beef is a strange gray mass. Not recommended. 

Thinking of coffee after dinner? It appears to have sat on a burner all day. Or all week. It's that bad.

All we could do was laugh, we were there for over 3 hours, had no more than 2 watered down drinks per hour and ordered 3 large appetizers.  We actually had pictures spread out on table as we were organizing a party.   Although earlier in the night another manager stopped by, sat with us, and was talking about different ideas she was hoping to promote.  We also observed a couple who came in with us and sat at the bar getting served shots the entire time we were there, apparently Scott didnt mind their eye/hand coordination since they were not taking up a table.

To top it off after experiencing coagulated meatballs, when I complained they were not warm, the ""manager"" (if he really was one), argued with me that they were cooked to temp, and when I asked for them to be heated in the microwave, he turned them into napalm and I scorched the roof of my mouth.  I tried to talk to said manager, and he was a complete and pompus ass.  The ONLY reason I even give this place 1 star, is because the bar drink I had was good.

Food- lets get to the food. First of all no where in town will you find a an appetizer, two steaks, four side dishes for 20 bucks. .its just crazy cheap. And its good. There are like 5 other options and many of them are good too! We haven't had anything we don't like so much. 
3RD I am super happy that they have a tiny brownie with a scoop of ice cream for ONE DOLLAR. yes, one fucking dollar! It's an awesome extra little treat. 
Also, The soup at Applebees is like 5 star home made stuff!! Particurally the Tortilla soup..You can not go wrong with it! I am also a huge fan of Tuscan Bean with Chicken and Sausage. I don't usually write these but I just had to show Applebee's some love because they are consistently good. And when I was dieting I still came here because they have tons of actually good options that are low calorie!! I was pleasantly surprised when most menus have a low calorie section that is just flavorless blahhh . Ok.. all and all. great place!!

Well, that happened this time. The service was so slow. The waiter seemed pulled multiple ways, and the food was just mediocre. The dish I normally get, the shrimp and rice with wonton chips was just OK. It barely had the soy sauce on it. They put my wonton tacos right on a plate.

Applebee's in Folsom is always just so disappointing. Some friends and I went on a Wednesday evening after 9pm not thinking that it would be too crowded for a week night for a quick bite. We arrived and there was no wait which was great. We were seated right away and everything appeared that it would go smoothly. There weren't a lot of people in there the wait staff seemed to be fully staffed, tables were clean. One would think ok great this should be a positive experience, right? 
Well, think again! 

After being seated for 20 min then a server finally came over to us and said I promise I'll be right back to get your drink order. Yep, you read that correctly 20 min and still no drinks or even a drink order take . After another 10 min the server finally took out drink order and it took another 15 min for them to finally arrive to our table. We ordered quickly since we had a ton of time to review the menu. Once ordered 2 other tables that came in after us were severed their food first. Once our food finally came out half of the table's food was cold. No drink refills, one person's mozzarella sticks were cold and  soggy as well. The whole experience was so disappointing and not quality. For a few friends just wanting to go get some quick appetizers we wound up being there to almost midnight. 3 hours for not much food and horrible service. Good thing I love my friends or it would have been a total waste of time.

I just don't get it. You should see the look on my face when I drive by on a Saturday and see people actually waiting outside for a table. 

Going here for a beer and some fries or wings to watch a game would be the only somewhat acceptable reason to be here.

 The food is just like all the other Applebees, out of a can and overcooked then allowed to cool to just below room temperature. I'll be honest, i swore off Applebees for life a couple years ago but Ive been to this one many times and felt I had to warn you in case for some reason you are on yelp but would still consider going to Applebees.

Let's start with the service horrible! Server went missing for 20mins and when he did show up forget about service with a smile. 2 stars is for the crab wonton tacos they were actually made correctly and the taste was as expected. They were the best part of the meal and it was only the appetizer. Also ordered spinach dip and the chips seemed to be the crumbs from bottom of the bag we had a few whole chips but mostly broken pieces and they were greasy and stale so we asked for different chips only to be told that was pretty much all they had all their chips were like that so we had them take them off. Finally comes the entree ordered the whiskey burger No flavor or sauce what's so ever and there must have been a shortage of fries bcuz the portion size was too small. Ordered our dessert to go and paid on the tablet just to get out of there we will not be going back to that location.

But with that said, I'm not crazy about Applebees.  First off, the restaurant chain as a whole refuses to provide nutritional information regarding their food unless required by law.  If you check out the website under their FAQs, you'll see what I mean.  And their food is constantly being placed on lists regarding how fatty and all the hidden calories they have in them.  Not cool.  

Anyway, my friends wanted to go here for dinner.  We put our name in, waited awhile and then got walked to our booth which was dirty. The seats had food partials and paper straw wrappers on it.    My aunt said, ""do you think we could get someone to clean this table??"" Our host's reply was ""oh, yeah...I guess I could get someone over here.""    

Our server came over and let us know that the drink special was long island iced teas...then let us know she had too many the night before, vomited, and really can't stand the look of them now but she was required to let us know. YUMMY! 

Our food took awhile to get to us but it was good and our server was great with refilling our drinks for us.  Since we had the tv right above us, random guys would stop right at our table and stare up which was strange.  

Two of the people I was dinning with were happy because they were able to order items that are  no longer on the menu but they still offer like the Fried Chicken Salad and the yellow queso ( they recently switched to a white queso that tastes different).

Its not my first choice of places to eat but will go there if everyone else in my group wants too.  I think because there are not many local places in Ridley Township to eat, this place will keep getting a lot of business."

Club House Grille  sandwich served VERY very cold and cheese is congealed. Top piece of bread toasted well, bottom piece extremely soggy. One very small end piece of tomato, what I am to assume is ham is very leathery, bacon cold and greasy. Turkey is peculiarly slimy . I've  come to find out that three customers had recently returned 3 meals at the bar alone. Joe is the kitchen manager . When wait staff brought it and the other returns to Joe's attention his first response was to comp, as if it is commonplace. I only ate about 20% of the salad and 0% of the sandwich. Huge disappointment, I did not accept comp as I feel it's unfair to Applebees at this point, but the GM needs to retrain Kitchen Manager or replace him.

Extremely disappointed in the host and manager on duty. We waited 25 minutes only to have a lady with her kids come in a good ten minuets after us be seated before us. Not only that but the hostess staff and a few of the wait staff stood around talking to the lady for a good five minutes and from the conversation you could tell she was either a current or past employee. 

We were seated at a table that was empty from the time we walked in! When several minutes went by without our waitress coming to the table I started timing how long it took. The waitress did notice this after she asked how we were. I did inform her I was not happy and informed her of what occurred. She did apologize and was very quick and responsive all night.the on duty manager came over to the table next to us to address the issue. The gentleman at the table informed him it was us that had the issue. When I explained the issue his response was that they take call heads and that is why the lady was seated before us and that the table we were seated at was left empty from the time we walked in because they had another call ahead and that we were told it was a twenty to twenty-five minute wait. The manager had a caviler attitude about the whole situation. 

I have never heard of Applebee's taking what amounts to a reservation before! 

Then to add to it the on duty manager discussed this with several other employees and was totally obvious about it!

A) You got a gift card from someone (reason I went tonight)
B) Friends you want to meet up with are already there and you've lost out on your chance to talk them into going somewhere else.
C) You really don't care.  

Truth is, when I have come here, I have been OK with this place.  I've generally had decent service.  Some of the food is ok.  I have found that with chain restaurants, especially the Applebee's chain, that you tend to get better eating experiences with the appetizers and desserts, and not so much with the entrees.  

So, your solution is to order up a couple of appetizers and a beer, and you probably won't complain as much.  But if you order up a steak or a plate of pasta you might regret it.  And I am certain that this goes for every other Applebee's restaurant out there.  

For instance, tonight I went (with a gift card), and ordered up the boneless wings which were decent.  The blackened chicken penne pasta dish however was mildly mediocre.  It wasn't really flavorful enough to be strongly mediocre.  The wife liked her Bourbon shrimp and chicken.  

Didn't bother with dessert.  After all, we only had a $25 gift card and I decided not to give them any actual money tonight.  But with the 2 for $20 deal, it worked out."

It was very delicately handled and not in any way overdone. The skin was thin and crispy but not greasy, and the meat was perfectly cooked. It came with zucchini, cherry tomatoes, and capers in a sauce that was somehow both creamy and light at the same time. I also tasted some dijon in there. The risotto was beautifully prepared, and was not heavy or sticky in any way. I ordered the Panna Cotta for dessert, which is like somewhere between flan and custard, and was wonderful as well. I will definitely be back soon!"

Cost:  $13.95 A GLASS for their house Chianti that sells for $10.99 a bottle retail.  Had I known....  WOW! My glass of wine was more than my stuffed pepper entree.
Quality:  2/3 of a restaurant.  Food was good,  nice price.  BUT I had to ask for a bread basket as I saw the tables around us had one with their drinks.  Never offered any pepper for the salad or cheese for the pasta.  No plates for the bread basket use.  No refills or ""how are you doing""  
Timeliness:  My salad came after my dinner (only by seconds) and my wive's spaghetti with meatballs, with my stuffed pepper took almost 45 to get to my table.  
You are on your own at this one.....Try the place 2 doors down first.

I arrived  prior to a show for a somewhat healthy vegetable dish.  I heard the food was good. It smelled amazing.  Somewhatt empty, but that was okay because it is beauriful.  I ordered the roasted eggplant.  The description sound amazing an totally delicious. So I wait with a glass of water for 45 minutes.  You think this is going to amazing.  The waitress delivers the dish and indicates the plate is Very hot be careful.  Literally, the eggplant was cut in half, possibly place in the oven to take the chill off and served with some kind of white sauce. The eggplant was so hard I could not cut it.  I took one bite and push the plate away. I had to ask the waitress to come over and asked if the dish was suppose to be served cold- she said no.  I informed her that was not very flavorful and appears uncooked.  She says let me see what I can do. I wait another 7-10 minutes and she apologizes and delivers a check.  No refill on the water.  No manager, the place was not crowded.  Absolutely terrible food and service.  Never again."

The pizza selection was diverse and creative.  I would certainly recommend this place to anyone seeking a great lunch or dinner spot in downtown.  Service was outstanding."

I went for lunch, kind of late, around 130-2 pm-ish.  There were two tables seated besides myself.  One of the cooks, must have just gotten off of work, and was sitting with some of the diners, who must have been his friends.  No biggie.  But when the phone rang, he started ordering people to answer it, esp. complaining about the front of the house.  He also was  talking to the pizza cook from the table...kinda irritating.  They were talking about the pepperoni orders from the food vendors,  he ordered hormel....bummer, sliced pepperoni is far superior, glad I did not get the pepperoni!  There were two people at the cash register doing something...and the girl behind the bar was waiting on the tables.  It just was a weird vibe.

It took quite a while for my order to be taken.  I ordered the pear and prosciutto pizza.  It had jalapenos and Gorgonzola cheese.  It was topped with prepackaged Parmesan, that did not melt, so it seemed an afterthought.  The dough was topped with honey, which was quite tasty, yet sticky.  I prefer my pizza thinner....They were trying out a Chicago style as a new menu option.

Maybe it was the timing, maybe it's the construction, but I was not impressed.  I was happy my drink was refilled promptly and the size of the pizza was plenty for lunch plus leftovers."

I called to get a reservation and was told they were full. Drove down there anyway, and the place was nearly empty. We were told that they were having kitchen issues, so anything with chicken and a few other items was unavailable. That constituted 70% of the menu. I got their last pasta carbonara, which tasted bad, and when they offered to substitute it with one of their last remaining items, a pesto pasta, it was even worse, since it was swimming in oil with little flavoring. I gave up. It was hard to get the servers' attention because they were mostly chatting with each other while two tables were occupied in the whole restaurant. During this whole process, the excuses switched from, ""We're having technical kitchen issues with some equipment"" to ""We have a kitchen inspection tomorrow"" to ""We didn't get our food shipment on time"" and finally, ""Our chef suddenly quit today."" The last one was the most believable, but I wish they had just decided on one excuse and closed their doors before I walked in. All of this after people raved to me about the place."

The polenta in the Drunken Shrimps appetizer was so amazing. I could eat a bucket of it I'm pretty sure.

We shared a 10' pizza and it was the perfect amount of food. They let you mix different pizza creations on one pizza, which is awesome. We had a half Toscana half Enoteca. I loved both halves of that pizza.

My dad raved about his eggplant with house made ricotta so when I go back I think I'll also try a non pizza entree.

No artichoke hearts so pizza won't be much of a draw for me.  However, I'm going to order the Margherita pizza (7 inches) to go and and eat the lamb meatball marinara sauce on spaghetti now .  Water to drink.

We had the best dining experience!  My best friend and I came across this place while visiting Tucson (in town for a band playing at the Rialto) and were in great need of food and wine before the show. 

We sat at the bar and immediately felt welcome.  One of the owners was behind the bar and took very good care of us the whole night.  The entire staff was nice and very accomodating.  We shared a bottle of wine (as well as a few lemon drop shots later in the night) and started out with the Caprese Salad and Enoteca Salad.  Both were delicious and very fresh.  We then decided to share a pizza and went with the Toscana.  Oh my!  This was absolutely wonderful and the combination of zucchini, salami and tomatoes was fantastic!  The sauce was yummy...it was not sweet like many pizza sauces can be at places.  It was cooked to perfection.  We couldn't get enough of it. Superb!!!

We ended up staying there for nearly 3 hours and watching the baseball playoffs.  We had the best time and left for the show feeling very happy and full (especially since this was the night the Giants clinched the NLCS)!

I found a real cannoli in Tucson!  They have cannolis for $3.50 a piece.  They use cheese as the filling, not cream like some of the other cop out places use.  The only problem, and this is a huge determining factor when deciding whether or not to order one, is that they are filled in the morning and sit in the refrigerator all day.  This allows the pastry to soften and become disgusting.  The cheesy creamy filling is outstanding.

The pizza tastes very generic.  The dough is crispy and tastes better than the average delivery, but the cheese and sauce and toppings are nothing special.  The wine selection is lacking, and for a wine bar, one would expect more.  The non-pizza-and-wine selections are creative and taste better than what they claim to do well.

Happy Hour is during their switch from lunch to dinner and has its own selected menu.  Entrees are about $7 each and include things like sandwiches and pasta, pizza slices are $3.50 each and wine and beer is $1 off.  Everything that I have tried during happy hour has been pre-made."

For a wine bar, it has a pretty bad selection.  And to make matters worse, they were out of the majority of their list since they hadn't stocked up for one of the areas biggest tourist events - the Tour de Tucson.  Really?  You didn't make sure you had enough wine beforehand?  Isn't Tour de Tucson like Black Friday for area restaurants?  

We had a pretty good zin.  And the pizza was pretty good.  The service, however, was excellent and they did a great job of accommodating  our reservation for 35 people.  Thank you for that!

It's been probably 4 years since I've last had Five Guys. The store wasn't too busy & we ordered our food to go. I ordered the smaller version with bacon. I've only had the big burger once and it was too much meat for me. I ordered the regular fries with Cajun. I one time made the mistake of a large and was shocked with how much they give you. The large should only be ordered if you're sharing or having your last meal. 

The burgers are cooked fresh and we waited at a table. They've got little baskets you can get of salted in the shell peanuts. Our order number was called about 10 minutes later and we left. The regular order of fries is still huge. You don't just get the cup full of fries but extras thrown in the bag. The Cajun fries are great. I like hot and spicy so I enjoy them. But you should get them if you don't like food with some heat. 

The burger is pretty good, I remembered once I took a bite of the burger that I really just like the Cajun fries here. The burger isn't bad, mind you but it's not anything to write home about (or Yelp). I don't know if it's the bun or how they wrap it but I feel like they always smash the burger.

first, five guys is awesome. the food is super. 

on the day i went, the staff here (mostly young kids) just seemed ""eh"" about the long line and crowd waiting. young girls were chatting with each other, not a care in the world about taking care to get the orders completed timely and efficiently.  the young guys seemed to be the hardest working ones, caring about people's wait. 

it took me 25 minutes to get my order...25!!! i've never had to wait that long at a  five guys, and i've been to ones that were much busier than this one. 

the food was good, as always; but, i think some of the staff (particularly the younger girls) need to be coached on the importance of not moving at a glacial pace and gossiping with giddy laughter as the wait line gets longer and longer."

You are like an ex-girlfriend that I just can't shake. I know that you are bad for me. I know I should stop calling on you, but I keep returning. When we are together, you fill me with so much joy and happiness. 

Honestly, this is a good burger. It's a chain, yes, but man, it's good. It is on the pricey side, and I know I could get the same thing in a bar for a few bucks less. 

The con that I have is that I placed an online order (love this), and when I arrived, the burgers were ready, but my fries weren't. They drop them when the customer comes to pick up the order. I had an internal debate about this, and deemed it ok. The fries were still warm, and the burgers (which are wrapped in foil) were still very warm. 

I love that you can build your own burger and add the fixin's that you want (and fresh jalapenos are fantastic).

I can't rate this a 5 star because it is just lunch fare, but I will give it a solid, SOLID, 4.5 stars."

For those with a gluten allergy, they take extra care to make sure they prepare it safely. If you ask for no bun, they always ask if its for an allergy.

Your not-so-ordinary toppings such as grilled mushrooms, jalapenos, and bell peppers are also on the available filling options. Did I tell you how big they are? They are not as wide as the Texas Whataburger, but they are tall. You almost have to unbuckle your jaw to take a bite if you want to savor the full burger. The kid's cheeseburger is large enough for two kids...and the large fries can feed a whole girl scouts club. Freshly cut potatoes, never frozen! Oh and by the way, better take your cardiac defibrillator...they are certainly not on the ""eat more of this"" food group since they are full of fat!

I went inside and it was a nice little setup they had mostly what you would see in any fast food place just a tad smaller. when u look at the menu the prices are a bit high but it's well worth it with what u get. I mean the toppings are free with whatever burger or hot dog u get while the drinks are the same as any joint but u get free refills and the fries..... well lets just say if ur not big on fries get the small but if u love them get the large you also can get Cajun seasoning for the fries if u want. the only reason i said what i said bout the fries is that if you get the regular or large they literally give you a small/med cup full of fries and depending on what size fries u requested they pour the scoop into the bag... basically ur getting almost a half bag full of fries along with ur hot dog/burger. They have grilled cheese if ur not craving the other options and finally they have peanuts if u like/love peanuts

I was actually somewhat disappointed. It wasn't bad and I am not going to trash the place. I think my brother summed it up best when he said it is one step above McDonald's, Wendy's, etc.  The food, drinks, and store set up are one notch above basic fast food but not that much more. I was expecting it to be more like Red Robin. Instead it was just ordinary. I ordered the Little Bacon Cheeseburger while my dad ordered Bacon Burger and my brother ordered the full size Bacon Cheeseburger. They prepare all of the hamburgers well done so you cannot get it cooked the way you like it. This means you are getting frozen patties and not something fresh. We did order one large fry that was enough for all three of us with plenty to spare. The fries actually were good and were probably a highlight. One interesting thing is that they serve unlimited peanuts in the shell like Logan's. Kinda seemed odd to be serving peanuts at a hamburger place. I would still recommend you try it out for yourself.

The cashier said that he can easily check for the bills himself, but the manager proceeded to continue to belittle his cashier in front of me.

Im guessing the oil they fry them in is changed regularly because they don't have that super greasy taste. They are bigger in size so I usually don't eat all 3. I also enjoy that they have coffee options I can enjoy since I can't do dairy. They offer both almond and soy ""milk"". I always go for the iced chai.

For a place with ""Coffee & Beignet"" in their name, there are two notable issues:
Beignets: They rarely, if ever, have them. I've been here for the past three days, and on two of those days, they had no beignets at all. Today, they had chocolate beignets only. A few years ago, they did have beignets, but apparently they can't figure out how to make them any more?
Coffee: Someone needs to teach the baristas how to steam milk. When the sound of the steaming changes, you need to pay attention, not just wander off or wait for the machine to figure out that you're not good at your job and turn off the steam for you. When the steamer has been going so long that it no longer makes any noise, you've thoroughly burned the milk. Two out of three of my mochas have been of the ""chocolate and char"" variety.

Finally, it's important to note that the service here is hit or miss. A couple of the employees seem enthusiastic about their jobs and work hard to help the customers. A couple other employees, today's cashier for example, are better at grumbling and rolling their eyes at customers. Some people just aren't cut out for customer service, and that's fine, but those folks should not be working the register.

In summary: If you're staying at the hotel and don't want to walk anywhere, this is a good choice. Otherwise, not so much."

It's located inside the Renaissance New Orleans Art Hotel. They have a cute window you order from then a cool dinning area under sky lights to sip on coffee and eat some beignets. 

Soooo yeah, the beignets are the best part of this place. It's $3 for 3 palm sized beignets, either with powdered sugar or filled with chocolate. I ordered powdered sugar every time and they always came out hot and fresh. They were really delicious, I honestly think they were just as good as Cafe Du Monde yet they were larger so maybe that makes them better!?

They sell beignets all day, as well as breakfast till 10:30am and other snacks throughout the day."

Went there on 5/10/19  with another couple - the husband's a Partner in a CPA firm.   Place is pretty and clean. I ordered the veal parm while the the other three ordered Scallops Calabrese. Female server was a little ""off"". Just some unusual quarks.  We'd say thank you and she'd respond with ""no problem"".   Wouldn't pick up our water glasses to fill them. I like to, tastefully, joke around with people and I was pleased that she took my jpking around as fun - and she held her ground - making the friendly banter enjoyable. 

Everyone praised their scallops. My veal, however, was over fried and the edges were so tough that they were hard to cut and not fit to eat.   The marinara sauce was watery and unenjoyable. Normally this would give them a 3 star. 

When we ordered my wife made it clear that we needed two separate checks because my wife had a groupon  voucher. The owner came out with our checks and started  lecture on how, since we didn't request separate checks, he couldn't separate them after the fact. My wife explained that she had requested separate checks but by this time he had dug in his heels. He started lecturing us in a very condisending tone. Starts doing the math to help my friend - yep, the CPA. When my wife said something he went on a  ""no, no, no, no,no,no - you don't understand "" rant. He actually became aggressive. At this point I wanted to slap him. Calmer heads prevailed and the owner apologized but the damage was done. 

Never again. A restaurant should a house of pleasant dining - not a house of abuse."

The food is really nothing special either.  Canned soup, uninspired salad, and entrees that are at best blah.  The bread was basically just a hunk of toasted roll with chopped garlic dumped on it, really not tasty at all unless you enjoy eating cloves of garlic.

Soft tacos and tamales were standard fare. Both are serviceable. Tacos had your standard iceberg lettuce, shredded cheese and tomatoes. Ground beef was seasoned well. Tamales were served in husk with no sauce. They were moist and cornbread had nice flavor. Meat was a little bland. Also got a quesadilla. Not much to say here other than it was a standard chicken quesadilla. 

Of note where the enchiladas. The mole they were served with was quite tasty. Thick and rich with flavor for anyone going back this is the dish to get in my opinion. 

Margaritas were nice and boozy. Bottle version not fresh squeezed. A pitcher did well for our group.
